### 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Sure! Letâ€™s tackle the problem step-by-step as you requested.

### 1. Repeat the Question

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers called `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, we need to find two distinct numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. We should return the indices of these two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array of length 2.

### 2. Suggest Examples and Edge Cases

**Examples:**

1. **Example 1:**

   - Input: `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
   - Output: `[1, 2]`
   - Explanation: `numbers[1] + numbers[2] = 2 + 7 = 9`.

2. **Example 2:**

   - Input: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 9, 10]`, `target = 8`
   - Output: `[4, 5]`
   - Explanation: `numbers[4] + numbers[5] = 4 + 4 = 8`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `numbers = [1, 3, 5, 6]`, `target = 9`
   - Output: `[3, 4]`
   - Explanation: `numbers[3] + numbers[4] = 5 + 4 = 9`.

**Edge Cases:**

1. **Minimum Length:**

   - Input: `numbers = [1, 2]`, `target = 3`
   - Output: `[1, 2]`
   - The smallest valid input.

2. **All Numbers the Same:**

   - Input: `numbers = [2, 2, 2, 2]`, `target = 4`
   - Output: `[1, 2]`
   - The solution must use different indices.

3. **Maximum Possible Values:**
   - Input: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, ..., 1000]`, `target = 1999`
   - Output: `[999, 1000]`
   - A performance case where the solution needs to be efficient.

### 3. Approach and Thought Process in Detail

**Approach:**

1. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Since the array is sorted, we can use two pointers to find the pair that sums to the target:
     - One pointer (`left`) starts at the beginning (index 0).
     - The other pointer (`right`) starts at the end (last index).
   - We calculate the sum of the values at these pointers.
     - If the sum equals the target, we return the 1-indexed positions.
     - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum.
     - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.
2. **Constraints:**
   - We need to ensure we use constant extra space (O(1)).

**Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the array because in the worst case, we may have to traverse the entire array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a fixed number of pointers and no additional space that scales with input size.

**Pseudo Code:**

```
function twoSum(numbers, target):
    left = 0
    right = length of numbers - 1

    while left < right:
        sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1] // convert to 1-indexed
        else if sum < target:
            increment left
        else:
            decrement right
```

### 4. Code in JavaScript with Comments

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function (numbers, target) {
  // Initialize two pointers
  let left = 0; // Start pointer at the beginning
  let right = numbers.length - 1; // End pointer at the end

  // Loop until the two pointers meet
  while (left < right) {
    let sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]; // Calculate the sum of the two pointed values

    if (sum === target) {
      // If we found the target, return their 1-indexed positions
      return [left + 1, right + 1]; // Convert to 1-indexed
    } else if (sum < target) {
      // If the sum is less than target, move left pointer to the right to increase the sum
      left++;
    } else {
      // If the sum is greater than target, move right pointer to the left to decrease the sum
      right--;
    }
  }

  // Since the problem guarantees exactly one solution, we should never reach here.
  return [];
};
```

### 5. Dry Run the Code Step by Step

**Example:** `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`

- **Initial State:**
  - `left = 0`, `right = 3`
- **Iteration 1:**

  - Calculate `sum = numbers[0] + numbers[3] = 2 + 15 = 17`.
  - `sum > target` (17 > 9), decrement `right`: `right = 2`.

- **Iteration 2:**

  - Calculate `sum = numbers[0] + numbers[2] = 2 + 11 = 13`.
  - `sum > target` (13 > 9), decrement `right`: `right = 1`.

- **Iteration 3:**
  - Calculate `sum = numbers[0] + numbers[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`.
  - `sum == target` (9 == 9), return `[1, 2]`.

### 6. Optimize and Suggest Alternative Methods

Your current solution using the two-pointer technique is already optimal given the constraints. However, here are some thoughts on alternatives:

1. **Binary Search:**

   - If we were not allowed to use two pointers, we could theoretically search for the complement (target - current) using binary search for each element, but this would yield O(n log n) complexity due to the binary search calls, which is worse than the O(n) of the two-pointer technique.

2. **Hash Map (Not Allowed Here):**
   - Using a hash map to store indices could allow for O(1) look-up, but this would require O(n) space, violating the constant space requirement.

### Conclusion

Your implementation of the two-pointer technique is efficient and meets the requirements of the problem. The method is clear, concise, and maintains constant space usage, making it an excellent choice for this problem.
