### 15. 3Sum

Let's walk through the solution to the "3Sum" problem, breaking it down step by step as per the interview guidelines:

### 1. Repeat the Question

We are given an integer array `nums`. We need to find all unique triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:

- `i`, `j`, and `k` are distinct indices.
- `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

We must return a list of all such triplets, and the solution should not contain any duplicate triplets.

### 2. Suggest Examples and Edge Cases

**Examples:**

1. **Example 1:**

   - Input: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`
   - Output: `[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`
   - Explanation: The two triplets that sum to zero are `[-1, -1, 2]` and `[-1, 0, 1]`.

2. **Example 2:**

   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `[]`
   - Explanation: There are no triplets that sum to zero.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `nums = [0, 0, 0]`
   - Output: `[[0, 0, 0]]`
   - Explanation: Only one valid triplet with sum zero exists.

**Edge Cases:**

- **Empty or very small array:** If `nums.length < 3`, the answer should be an empty list (`[]`) because we can't form a triplet.
- **Duplicates:** If the array has multiple identical values, we need to ensure that our solution doesn't return duplicate triplets, like `[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]]`.

### 3. Approach and Thought Process

**Approach:**

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Start by sorting the input array `nums`. Sorting helps in efficiently handling duplicates and applying the two-pointer technique to find pairs that sum to a specific value.
2. **Iterating and Applying Two-Pointer Technique:**

   - Iterate through each element of the sorted array, treating it as a potential first element of the triplet.
   - For each element, use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find two additional numbers whose sum, when added to the current number, equals zero.
   - Skip duplicates to avoid adding the same triplet multiple times.

3. **Skipping Duplicates:**
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one, skip it to prevent duplicate triplets in the result.

**Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we are iterating through the array and, for each element, performing a two-pointer scan of the rest of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (ignoring the space required for the output).

### Pseudo Code:

```
function threeSum(nums):
    sort(nums)
    result = []

    for i from 0 to length of nums - 2:
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue // Skip duplicates

        left = i + 1
        right = length of nums - 1

        while left < right:
            sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

            if sum == 0:
                add [nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]] to result
                left++
                right--
                // Skip duplicates for left and right pointers
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:
                    left++
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right + 1]:
                    right--
            else if sum < 0:
                left++
            else:
                right--

    return result
```

### 4. Code in JavaScript with Comments

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var threeSum = function (nums) {
  // Sort the array to allow the two-pointer technique and handle duplicates
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Result array to store unique triplets
  const result = [];

  // Iterate over each element to consider it as the first element of a triplet
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    // Skip duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets
    if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) {
      continue;
    }

    // Initialize two pointers: one at i+1 (left) and one at the end (right)
    let left = i + 1;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    // While the left pointer is less than the right pointer
    while (left < right) {
      const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

      // If we found a triplet that sums to zero
      if (sum === 0) {
        result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);

        // Move the left pointer forward and skip duplicates
        left++;
        while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left - 1]) {
          left++;
        }

        // Move the right pointer backward and skip duplicates
        right--;
        while (left < right && nums[right] === nums[right + 1]) {
          right--;
        }
      }
      // If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to increase the sum
      else if (sum < 0) {
        left++;
      }
      // If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to decrease the sum
      else {
        right--;
      }
    }
  }

  // Return the result array containing all the unique triplets
  return result;
};
```

### 5. Dry Run the Code Step by Step

**Example 1: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`**

1. **Sort `nums`:** `[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`
2. **First iteration (`i = 0`, `nums[i] = -4`):**

   - Set `left = 1`, `right = 5`.
   - Calculate sum = `-4 + (-1) + 2 = -3` → Move `left` pointer to 2.
   - Calculate sum = `-4 + (-1) + 2 = -3` → Move `left` pointer to 3.
   - Calculate sum = `-4 + 0 + 2 = -2` → Move `left` pointer to 4.
   - Calculate sum = `-4 + 1 + 2 = -1` → Move `left` pointer to 5.
   - Exit loop for this `i`.

3. **Second iteration (`i = 1`, `nums[i] = -1`):**

   - Set `left = 2`, `right = 5`.
   - Calculate sum = `-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0` → Add `[-1, -1, 2]` to result.
   - Move `left` to 3, right to 4.
   - Calculate sum = `-1 + 0 + 1 = 0` → Add `[-1, 0, 1]` to result.
   - Move `left` to 4, right to 3 → Exit loop.

4. **Third iteration (`i = 2`, `nums[i] = -1`)** is skipped due to duplication.

5. **Fourth iteration (`i = 3`, `nums[i] = 0`):**

   - Set `left = 4`, `right = 5`.
   - Calculate sum = `0 + 1 + 2 = 3` → Move `right` to 4 → Exit loop.

6. **Result:** `[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`.

### 6. Optimizations and Alternative Methods

The current approach is already optimized with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for this type of problem. Here are some considerations:

1. **Brute Force Approach:**

   - A brute-force approach would involve checking all possible triplets with three nested loops. This would have a time complexity of O(n^3), which is inefficient for large inputs.

2. **Hash Set Approach:**
   - One could use a hash set to track complements when searching for pairs that sum to a specific value, but it would not be as efficient in handling duplicates and might use more space than necessary.

### Conclusion

This two-pointer approach is both time and space efficient, handling the problem in O(n^2) time with O(1) extra space (ignoring the result storage). It ensures no duplicate triplets by using sorted arrays and skipping repeated elements.
