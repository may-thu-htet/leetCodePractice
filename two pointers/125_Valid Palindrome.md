### 1. **Repeating the Question**

The problem is: We are given a string `s`. We need to check whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same forward and backward after:

- Converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.
- Removing all non-alphanumeric characters (i.e., letters and numbers are kept, everything else is discarded).

The function should return `true` if the string is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

### 2. **Examples and Edge Cases**

#### Examples:

1. **Input:** `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** After converting to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters, the string becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama", which is a palindrome.
2. **Input:** `s = "race a car"`  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** After processing, the string becomes "raceacar", which is not a palindrome.

#### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty String:**  
   **Input:** `s = ""`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** An empty string is trivially a palindrome.

2. **String with only non-alphanumeric characters:**  
   **Input:** `s = "!!!"`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** After removing non-alphanumeric characters, the string becomes empty, and an empty string is considered a palindrome.

3. **Single Character String:**  
   **Input:** `s = "a"`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** A single character is always a palindrome.

### 3. **Approach and Thought Process**

#### Approach:

1. **Step 1:** We need to filter out non-alphanumeric characters.
2. **Step 2:** Convert the string to lowercase.
3. **Step 3:** Check whether the cleaned string reads the same forwards and backwards.

#### Thought Process:

1. **Two-Pointer Approach:**
   - Use two pointers: one starting from the beginning and the other from the end.
   - Move both pointers towards the center of the string.
   - Compare characters at both pointers:
     - If characters are equal, continue.
     - If characters are not equal, return `false`.
   - If the pointers cross or meet, return `true` (meaning the string is a palindrome).

#### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**

  - We traverse the string once to filter and convert it to lowercase: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
  - We then traverse the filtered string with two pointers: O(n).
  - Hence, the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - We store the cleaned string: O(n).
  - Therefore, the space complexity is also **O(n)**.

#### Alternative Approach:

We can avoid creating an additional string by checking characters in place (ignoring non-alphanumeric characters during the two-pointer comparison), which reduces space complexity to **O(1)**.

### Pseudo Code

```plaintext
function isPalindrome(s):
    cleaned_string = ""

    # Step 1: Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    for each character c in s:
        if c is alphanumeric:
            append lowercase(c) to cleaned_string

    # Step 2: Use two pointers to check if the cleaned_string is a palindrome
    left = 0
    right = length of cleaned_string - 1

    while left < right:
        if cleaned_string[left] is not equal to cleaned_string[right]:
            return false
        move left pointer to the right
        move right pointer to the left

    return true
```

### 4. **JavaScript Code with Comments**

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  // Step 1: Filter out non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
  let cleanedString = "";

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const char = s[i];

    // Check if the character is alphanumeric using a regex
    if (/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(char)) {
      cleanedString += char.toLowerCase(); // Convert to lowercase and add to cleaned string
    }
  }

  // Step 2: Initialize two pointers for the palindrome check
  let left = 0;
  let right = cleanedString.length - 1;

  // Step 3: Check the cleaned string with two pointers
  while (left < right) {
    if (cleanedString[left] !== cleanedString[right]) {
      return false; // If characters do not match, it's not a palindrome
    }
    left++; // Move the left pointer right
    right--; // Move the right pointer left
  }

  return true; // If no mismatches found, it's a palindrome
}
```

### 5. **Dry Run**

Let's dry-run the code with the input `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`.

1. **Step 1: Clean the string**
   - Initial string: `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
   - Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase:
     - Result: `"amanaplanacanalpanama"`
2. **Step 2: Two-pointer check**

   - Pointers: `left = 0`, `right = 20`
   - Compare characters at `left` and `right`: Both are `"a"`. Move `left` to 1, `right` to 19.
   - Compare again: Both are `"m"`. Continue...
   - Keep comparing until pointers meet in the middle.

   Since no mismatch is found, return `true`.

### 6. **Optimization and Alternative Methods**

#### Optimized Approach (In-place Two Pointer):

We can avoid storing the cleaned string and directly perform the palindrome check using two pointers in one pass.

**Optimized Code:**

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
  // Step 1: Initialize two pointers, one from the start and one from the end
  let left = 0;
  let right = s.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    // Skip non-alphanumeric characters from the left
    while (left < right && !/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(s[left])) {
      left++;
    }

    // Skip non-alphanumeric characters from the right
    while (left < right && !/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(s[right])) {
      right--;
    }

    // Compare characters after converting to lowercase
    if (s[left].toLowerCase() !== s[right].toLowerCase()) {
      return false; // If mismatch found, it's not a palindrome
    }

    // Move the pointers inward
    left++;
    right--;
  }

  return true; // If all characters matched, it's a palindrome
}
```

#### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** Still O(n) as we are processing the string in one pass with two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we are not using extra space for storing the cleaned string.

This in-place approach optimizes the space usage.
