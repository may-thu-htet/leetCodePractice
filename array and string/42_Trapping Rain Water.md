### 42. Trapping Rain Water

### Step 1: Repeat the Question

We are given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1 unit. We need to compute how much water can be trapped between the bars after it rains. Essentially, the bars represent heights in a 2D landscape, and the goal is to determine how much water is "trapped" between the heights.

### Step 2: Suggest Examples and Edge Cases

#### Example 1:

```js
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The elevation map forms valleys where water is trapped.
```

#### Example 2:

```js
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
Explanation: Water is trapped between the taller bars.
```

#### Edge Cases:

1. **No height at all (empty array):**
   ```js
   Input: height = []
   Output: 0 (No bars, no water can be trapped).
   ```
2. **All bars of the same height:** No water can be trapped since the surface is flat.
   ```js
   Input: height = [3, 3, 3];
   Output: 0;
   ```
3. **Only two bars:** Not enough bars to trap any water.
   ```js
   Input: height = [1, 2];
   Output: 0;
   ```

### Step 3: Approach and Thought Process

#### Thought Process:

The amount of water that can be trapped at a given bar depends on the **tallest bar to the left** and the **tallest bar to the right** of it. For any given bar `i`:

- The water trapped above bar `i` is equal to the **minimum** of the tallest bar to its left and the tallest bar to its right, **minus** the height of the bar `i` itself.

#### Approach:

1. **Brute force approach** (not optimal): For each bar, calculate the maximum height of bars to the left and right, then compute how much water is trapped above that bar. This would have a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.

2. **Optimized approach using two arrays** (space `O(n)`, time `O(n)`):

   - Use two arrays: `leftMax` and `rightMax` to precompute the maximum height of the bars to the left and right of each bar.
   - Traverse the `height` array and compute the water trapped at each index using the formula:  
     `water[i] = min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]`.

3. **Optimized two-pointer approach** (space `O(1)`, time `O(n)`):
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to traverse the height array. The pointer that points to the shorter side will determine how much water can be trapped.
   - Maintain two variables (`leftMax` and `rightMax`) to keep track of the tallest bar on the left and right sides while iterating through the array.

#### Approach 3 (Two-pointer) in Detail:

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end of the array.
2. Initialize `leftMax` and `rightMax` to track the tallest bars to the left and right.
3. Move the pointers toward each other and compute the water trapped at each position based on the minimum of `leftMax` and `rightMax`.
4. If `leftMax` is less than `rightMax`, water trapped depends on the left side; otherwise, it depends on the right side.

#### Pseudocode:

```
1. Initialize two pointers `left = 0` and `right = n - 1`
2. Initialize `leftMax = 0`, `rightMax = 0`, and `water = 0`
3. While `left` is less than `right`:
    - If `height[left] < height[right]`:
        - If `height[left] >= leftMax`, update `leftMax`
        - Else, add `leftMax - height[left]` to `water`
        - Move `left` pointer to the right
    - Else:
        - If `height[right] >= rightMax`, update `rightMax`
        - Else, add `rightMax - height[right]` to `water`
        - Move `right` pointer to the left
4. Return `water`
```

### Step 4: Code in JavaScript

```javascript
function trap(height) {
  // Step 1: Initialize two pointers, leftMax and rightMax, and water accumulator
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let leftMax = 0;
  let rightMax = 0;
  let water = 0;

  // Step 2: Move the pointers towards each other
  while (left < right) {
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      // Step 3a: If height[left] is less, calculate water from the left
      if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
        leftMax = height[left]; // Update leftMax
      } else {
        water += leftMax - height[left]; // Calculate trapped water
      }
      left++; // Move left pointer
    } else {
      // Step 3b: If height[right] is less, calculate water from the right
      if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
        rightMax = height[right]; // Update rightMax
      } else {
        water += rightMax - height[right]; // Calculate trapped water
      }
      right--; // Move right pointer
    }
  }

  // Step 4: Return the total trapped water
  return water;
}
```

### Step 5: Dry Run the Code

Letâ€™s dry run with `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`:

#### Initial setup:

```js
(left = 0), (right = 11), (leftMax = 0), (rightMax = 0), (water = 0);
```

#### First iteration (`left = 0`, `right = 11`):

- `height[left] = 0`, `height[right] = 1`
- Since `height[left] < height[right]`, update `leftMax = 0`.
- Move `left` to 1.

#### Second iteration (`left = 1`, `right = 11`):

- `height[left] = 1`, `height[right] = 1`
- Since `height[left] >= leftMax`, update `leftMax = 1`.
- Move `right` to 10.

#### Continue this until pointers converge.

Final output: `water = 6` (the water trapped).

### Step 6: Optimize and Suggest Alternative Methods

#### Current Approach (Two-Pointer):

- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` because we traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` since we only use a few extra variables (left, right, leftMax, rightMax, water).

#### Alternative Approaches:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** We could use precomputed `leftMax` and `rightMax` arrays to store the maximum heights to the left and right of each element. This would also have `O(n)` time complexity but would require `O(n)` space.
2. **Brute Force Approach:** For each bar, we calculate the maximum height on its left and right, which would result in `O(n^2)` time complexity.

The two-pointer approach is the most optimized solution for both time and space complexity.
