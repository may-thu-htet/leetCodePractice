### 1. Repeat the Question:

You are given an array `nums` of length `n`, where each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from index `i`. Your task is to determine the **minimum number of jumps** required to reach the last index of the array (`nums[n-1]`), starting from the first index (`nums[0]`). It's guaranteed that reaching the last index is possible.

### 2. Examples and Edge Cases:

#### Examples:

- **Example 1:**

  ```js
  Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  - Jump 1 step from index 0 to index 1 (nums[0] = 2 allows you to jump 1 or 2 steps).
  - Then, jump 3 steps from index 1 to index 4 (nums[1] = 3 allows this).
  - Total: 2 jumps.
  ```

- **Example 2:**
  ```js
  Input: nums = [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  - Jump 1 step from index 0 to index 1.
  - Jump 3 steps from index 1 to index 4.
  - Total: 2 jumps.
  ```

#### Edge Cases:

- **Edge Case 1**: If the array has only one element (`nums = [0]`), no jumps are needed (`output = 0`).
- **Edge Case 2**: If the input array contains large jumps initially, fewer jumps may be required.
- **Edge Case 3**: If there's a sequence of `1`s in the array, you'll need multiple jumps but still want to minimize them.

### 3. Approach, Thought Process, and Complexity:

#### Thought Process:

We want to find the **minimum number of jumps** to reach the last index. This can be solved efficiently using a **Greedy Approach**.

##### Key Idea:

1. We maintain a `farthest` variable to track the farthest index we can reach at any point.
2. We also maintain a `currentEnd` variable to track the farthest point we can jump to within the current jump.
3. Whenever we reach `currentEnd`, it means we need to make another jump, so we increment the jump count and update `currentEnd` to the `farthest` point we can reach.
4. We continue this process until we can reach or pass the last index.

#### Pseudo Code Plan:

1. Initialize:
   - `farthest = 0` to track the farthest reachable index.
   - `currentEnd = 0` to track the end of the current jump.
   - `jumps = 0` to count the number of jumps.
2. Traverse the array (except the last element because when we reach it, we're done):
   - At each index `i`, update `farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])` (the furthest we can reach from the current index).
   - If we reach `currentEnd`, increment the jump count and update `currentEnd` to `farthest`.
3. Once we reach or pass the last index, return the number of jumps.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we use only a few variables for tracking the farthest and current endpoints.

### 4. Code in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var jump = function (nums) {
  // Initialize variables to track farthest reach, current end of jump, and jump count
  let farthest = 0;
  let currentEnd = 0;
  let jumps = 0;

  // Traverse the array up to the second last element (no need to jump from last index)
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
    // Update the farthest we can reach from current index i
    farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);

    // If we've reached the end of the current jump segment
    if (i === currentEnd) {
      // We need another jump, so increment jump count
      jumps++;
      // Update the end of this jump segment to the farthest we can reach
      currentEnd = farthest;
    }
  }

  // Return the total number of jumps needed to reach the last index
  return jumps;
};
```

### 5. Dry Run:

#### Input: `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`

- **Initialization**: `farthest = 0`, `currentEnd = 0`, `jumps = 0`
- **Step 1** (`i = 0`):
  - `farthest = max(0, 0 + 2) = 2`
  - Since `i == currentEnd`, increment `jumps = 1` and update `currentEnd = 2`
- **Step 2** (`i = 1`):
  - `farthest = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4`
  - `i != currentEnd`, so no jump increment yet.
- **Step 3** (`i = 2`):
  - `farthest = max(4, 2 + 1) = 4`
  - Since `i == currentEnd`, increment `jumps = 2` and update `currentEnd = 4`
- **Step 4** (`i = 3`):
  - `farthest = max(4, 3 + 1) = 4`
  - `i != currentEnd`, so no jump increment.
- **Exit the loop** (since `currentEnd >= nums.length - 1`)

- **Final Output**: `2` (minimum number of jumps)

### 6. Optimization and Alternative Methods:

#### Greedy Approach (Current):

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because only a few variables are used.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Alternative:

You can also solve this using a BFS-like approach where each level represents a jump, and you explore all reachable indices from the current index. While this would work, it would have higher space complexity due to the need for a queue. This would be unnecessary since the greedy approach already gives optimal results in O(n).

**Pseudo Code for BFS:**

1. Initialize a queue with the starting index, level of jumps (starting at 0).
2. For each index, explore all possible jumps from that index.
3. Stop when you reach the last index, and return the level of jumps.

**Complexity of BFS**:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case due to exploring all possible jumps from each index.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because of the queue used for level traversal.

### Conclusion:

The **greedy approach** is optimal for this problem due to its linear time complexity and constant space usage. It's efficient for real-time execution in coding interviews, as it minimizes the number of jumps while maintaining simplicity.
