### 151.Reverse Words in a String

Sure! Let's go through the problem step by step as per your requirements.

### 1. Repeat the Question

**Question**: Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space. Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

### 2. Suggest Examples and Edge Cases

#### Examples:

1. **Example 1**:

   - **Input**: `"  the   sky  is  blue  "`
   - **Output**: `"blue is sky the"`

2. **Example 2**:

   - **Input**: `"Hello   World"`
   - **Output**: `"World Hello"`

3. **Example 3**:
   - **Input**: `"a b c d e"`
   - **Output**: `"e d c b a"`

#### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty String**:

   - **Input**: `""`
   - **Output**: `""` (no words to reverse)

2. **String with Only Spaces**:

   - **Input**: `"     "`
   - **Output**: `""` (no words to reverse)

3. **Single Word**:

   - **Input**: `"  hello  "`
   - **Output**: `"hello"` (only one word)

4. **Multiple Spaces Between Words**:
   - **Input**: `"  hello   world  "`
   - **Output**: `"world hello"` (extra spaces should be removed)

### 3. Approach and Thought Process

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Trim and Split**: Remove leading and trailing spaces and split the string into words based on spaces. This can be done using `split(' ')`, which will include empty strings for multiple spaces.

2. **Filter Out Empty Strings**: After splitting, filter out any empty strings from the resulting array to clean it up.

3. **Reverse the Words**: Reverse the order of the words in the array.

4. **Join the Words**: Concatenate the reversed words with a single space between them.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the final string.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. We are iterating through the string multiple times (for splitting, filtering, and reversing).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the words in an array.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
function reverseWords(s):
    // Step 1: Trim leading and trailing spaces
    trimmed_string = trim(s)

    // Step 2: Split the string into words
    words = split(trimmed_string, ' ')

    // Step 3: Filter out empty strings
    filtered_words = filter(words)

    // Step 4: Reverse the array of words
    reversed_words = reverse(filtered_words)

    // Step 5: Join the words with a single space
    result = join(reversed_words, ' ')

    return result
```

### 4. JavaScript Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s how we can implement the above logic in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function (s) {
  // Step 1: Trim leading and trailing spaces
  let trimmedString = s.trim();

  // Step 2: Split the string into words
  let words = trimmedString.split(" ");

  // Step 3: Filter out empty strings caused by multiple spaces
  let filteredWords = words.filter((word) => word.length > 0);

  // Step 4: Reverse the array of words
  let reversedWords = filteredWords.reverse();

  // Step 5: Join the reversed words with a single space
  return reversedWords.join(" ");
};
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Trimming**: `s.trim()` removes leading and trailing spaces from the string.
2. **Splitting**: `trimmedString.split(' ')` splits the string into an array of words.
3. **Filtering**: `words.filter(word => word.length > 0)` removes any empty strings from the array.
4. **Reversing**: `filteredWords.reverse()` reverses the order of the words.
5. **Joining**: `reversedWords.join(' ')` combines the words into a single string with spaces in between.

### 5. Dry Run the Code Step by Step

Let's dry run the function with the input `"  the   sky  is  blue  "`.

1. **Input**: `"  the   sky  is  blue  "`
2. **Trimmed String**:
   - After `trim()`: `"the   sky  is  blue"`
3. **Splitting**:
   - After `split(' ')`: `["the", "", "", "sky", "", "is", "", "blue"]`
4. **Filtering**:
   - After `filter(word => word.length > 0)`: `["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]`
5. **Reversing**:
   - After `reverse()`: `["blue", "is", "sky", "the"]`
6. **Joining**:
   - After `join(' ')`: `"blue is sky the"`
7. **Output**: `"blue is sky the"`

### 6. Optimize and Suggest Alternative Methods

#### Alternative Method:

If we consider languages where strings are mutable, such as Python (using lists), we can solve this in-place with O(1) extra space. However, in JavaScript, we typically cannot manipulate strings in place due to their immutability.

#### In-Place Approach (Pseudocode):

If you were to implement an in-place solution in a language that supports mutable strings (like C++ with `std::vector<char>`), the following steps could be taken:

1. **Reverse the entire string**.
2. **Reverse each word within the reversed string**.
3. **Cleanup spaces** to ensure only one space between words and no leading or trailing spaces.

The complexity remains O(n) for both time and space, as you would still be using the same character array but without allocating new structures.

#### Conclusion:

The provided JavaScript solution is efficient and straightforward for reversing words in a string, maintaining a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n). For languages with mutable string capabilities, an in-place approach can also be applied with similar complexity.
