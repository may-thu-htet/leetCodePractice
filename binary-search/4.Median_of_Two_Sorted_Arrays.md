### 1. Repeat the Question:

We are given two sorted arrays, `nums1` of size `m` and `nums2` of size `n`. We need to find the median of these two sorted arrays. The solution must have a time complexity of \(O(\log(m+n))\).

### 2. Examples and Edge Cases:

Let's consider a few examples and edge cases:

- **Example 1:**
  - `nums1 = [1, 3]`, `nums2 = [2]`
  - Median: `2.0`
- **Example 2:**
  - `nums1 = [1, 2]`, `nums2 = [3, 4]`
  - Median: `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`
- **Example 3 (edge case with empty array):**
  - `nums1 = []`, `nums2 = [1]`
  - Median: `1.0`
- **Example 4 (all elements in one array):**
  - `nums1 = [1]`, `nums2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Median: `3.0`

### 3. Approach and Thought Process:

The problem requires a time complexity of \(O(\log(m+n))\), meaning we cannot simply merge the two arrays and then find the median using brute force.

We'll use a **binary search** on the smaller array to ensure logarithmic time complexity. Here's the general plan:

1. The median divides the merged array into two halves of equal size.
2. We can partition both `nums1` and `nums2` such that the left part of both arrays combined is smaller than or equal to the right part.
3. Perform binary search on the smaller array (let's assume `nums1`) to find a valid partition. Then, calculate the median based on the partition.

**Key Considerations:**

- If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the max element of the left partition.
- If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the max of the left partition and the min of the right partition.

**Time Complexity**:

- The time complexity will be \(O(\log \min(m, n))\) because we perform binary search on the smaller array.

### Pseudocode:

```
1. Let m be the length of nums1 and n be the length of nums2.
2. Ensure nums1 is the smaller array; swap if needed.
3. Set low = 0, high = m (the range to binary search).
4. While low <= high:
     a. Partition nums1 and nums2 based on mid = (low + high) / 2.
     b. Check if the left partition of both arrays contains valid values:
        i. maxLeft1 <= minRight2 and maxLeft2 <= minRight1
     c. If valid:
        - If total length (m + n) is odd, return max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2).
        - Else return average of max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2) and min(minRight1, minRight2).
     d. Adjust the binary search range based on the partition validity.
5. If no valid partition, return -1 (invalid input or edge cases).
```

### 4. Code in JavaScript with Comments:

```javascript
function findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2) {
  // Ensure nums1 is the smaller array to minimize binary search operations
  if (nums1.length > nums2.length) {
    return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1); // Swap for optimization
  }

  let m = nums1.length;
  let n = nums2.length;
  let low = 0,
    high = m;

  while (low <= high) {
    // Partitioning nums1 and nums2
    let partition1 = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    let partition2 = Math.floor((m + n + 1) / 2) - partition1;

    // Edge cases when partition is at 0 or at the end of the array
    let maxLeft1 = partition1 === 0 ? -Infinity : nums1[partition1 - 1];
    let minRight1 = partition1 === m ? Infinity : nums1[partition1];

    let maxLeft2 = partition2 === 0 ? -Infinity : nums2[partition2 - 1];
    let minRight2 = partition2 === n ? Infinity : nums2[partition2];

    // Check if we have found the correct partition
    if (maxLeft1 <= minRight2 && maxLeft2 <= minRight1) {
      // If total number of elements is odd, return max of left side
      if ((m + n) % 2 === 1) {
        return Math.max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2);
      } else {
        // Otherwise, return average of max of left and min of right
        return (
          (Math.max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2) + Math.min(minRight1, minRight2)) / 2
        );
      }
    }
    // Adjust search space if partition is incorrect
    else if (maxLeft1 > minRight2) {
      high = partition1 - 1; // Move left in nums1
    } else {
      low = partition1 + 1; // Move right in nums1
    }
  }

  // If we exit the loop, there's no valid median (shouldn't happen in valid input)
  throw new Error("Input arrays are not valid for finding median");
}
```

### 5. Dry Run:

Let's dry run the function with `nums1 = [1, 3]` and `nums2 = [2]`.

1. Initially, `nums1` is already smaller, so no swap is needed.
2. `m = 2`, `n = 1`.
3. Set `low = 0`, `high = 2` (length of `nums1`).
4. First iteration:
   - `partition1 = (0 + 2) // 2 = 1`
   - `partition2 = (2 + 1 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `maxLeft1 = nums1[0] = 1`, `minRight1 = nums1[1] = 3`
   - `maxLeft2 = nums2[0] = 2`, `minRight2 = Infinity (since nums2[1] does not exist)`
5. Since `maxLeft1 <= minRight2` and `maxLeft2 <= minRight1`, we found the correct partition.
6. Total number of elements is 3 (odd), so return `Math.max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2) = Math.max(1, 2) = 2.0`.

### 6. Optimization and Alternative Methods:

- The current solution is already optimized to \(O(\log \min(m, n))\), which is optimal for this problem.
- **Alternative approach (not efficient for large inputs)**: We could merge the two arrays and find the median, but this would result in \(O(m+n)\) time complexity, which does not meet the problem's requirement.
